# 🌍 Breaking Down Barriers: Legal Texts Should Be Accessible to Everyone 🌍  

Legal texts are often locked behind **language barriers**, **formal barriers**, and **gatekeeping practices** that make them inaccessible to many. Tiny, unreadable fonts in proprietary PDF readers, inaccessible prints in books, and a complete disregard for neurodivergent and visually impaired individuals—these are just a few of the ways the system fails people.  

This project is a **"fuck you"** to all of that.

## 🚨 The Problem  
- **Tiny, unreadable fonts**: Ever tried reading 8-pt text with no spacing or proper formatting? It’s  
- **Inaccessible formats**: Proprietary PDF readers that don’t allow proper zooming or text-to-speech functionality.  
- **No regard for neurodivergent individuals**: Legal texts are often dense, convoluted, and impossible to navigate for people with ADHD, dyslexia, or other cognitive differences.  
- **No regard for blind people**: Lack of screen-reader compatibility and accessible formats.  
- **Arrogant publishing practices**: Texts are designed by and for those who are willing to bend over backward to access them.

## 💥 My Story  
When I studied law, I spent countless hours **"hacking"** every eBook I bought just to make the text readable. I had to fight against tiny fonts, poor formatting, and proprietary systems that seemed designed to exclude anyone who didn’t fit the mold. It was exhausting, infuriating, and dehumanizing.  

This project is my way of saying: **Enough is enough.**

### 🌍 **Open-Source Legal Translation Project: Making Law Accessible, One Translation at a Time!** 🌍  

Hey there, legal enthusiasts, language nerds, and open-source lovers! 👋  

I’m excited to share an open-source project I’ve been tinkering with for a while now. It’s all about making legal texts more accessible by translating them accurately and transparently—without any hidden costs or corporate gatekeeping. 🚫💸  

This project started as a personal need (and a bit of a panic 😅) during my Master’s thesis. I accidentally picked a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling that was **80 pages long… in French.** Oops! 🙈 (I confused it with another court that usually publishes in 20+ languages. Lesson learned: always check the language first!)  

After struggling with DeepL and wrestling with ChatGPT’s legal disclaimers and token limits, I realized there had to be a better way. So, I started building my own system—a slow, transparent, and peer-reviewed bot that focuses on **one task only**: translating legal texts as accurately as possible. No interpretations, no legal advice, just 1:1 translations with tweaks to ensure precision. 🎯  

---

### 🛠️ **What’s the Goal?**  

1. **Accessibility for All** 🌐  
   Legal texts are often locked behind language barriers, making them inaccessible to many. This project aims to break down those barriers by providing accurate translations of court rulings and legal documents.  

2. **Open-Source & Free** 🆓  
   I’m passionate about keeping this project free and open-source. No paid services, no corporate ownership, no gatekeeping. Just a community-driven effort to make law more accessible.  

3. **Transparency & Peer Review** 🔍  
   The translations will be slow and methodical, with a focus on transparency. Every step will be peer-reviewed to ensure accuracy and reliability.  

4. **No Legal Advice, Just Translations** ⚖️  
   This bot won’t interpret laws or give legal advice. It’s strictly for translating existing legal texts—nothing more, nothing less.  

---

### 🤖 **How Does It Work?**  

The bot follows a strict set of rules to ensure accuracy:  
- **1:1 Translations**: The original meaning of the text is preserved at all costs.  
- **No Redundant Cuts**: If a legal text repeats something, the bot repeats it too. No shortcuts!  
- **Peer Review**: Every translation is reviewed by the community to catch errors and suggest improvements.  
- **Glossaries & Indexes**: Over time, we’ll build glossaries, indexes, and summaries to make the translations even more user-friendly.  

Right now, the focus is on translating French and Italian court rulings (BGE) into other languages. But the goal is to expand to more languages and legal systems over time. 🌱  

---

### 🧩 **Why Open-Source?**  

I have no technical background (coding is not my thing, sorry! 🖥️), but I love tinkering with legal prompts and bots. I’ve been doing this manually for a while, and while it’s slow, it’s also incredibly rewarding.  

However, I know this project can be so much better with the help of a community. If you’re a coder, a linguist, or just someone who’s passionate about open-source and accessibility, I’d love to collaborate! Let’s build something amazing together. 🤝  

---

### 🚨 **What’s Next?**  

Here’s the plan:  
1. **Start Small**: Focus on translating French and Italian court rulings.  
2. **Build a Community**: Open the project to peer review and feedback.  
3. **Expand**: Add more languages, legal systems, and features like glossaries and summaries.  
4. **Keep It Fun**: This project is a labor of love, so let’s keep it approachable and enjoyable for everyone involved.  

---

### 🙌 **How Can You Help?**  

- **Feedback**: Check out the first translations and let me know what you think!  
- **Collaborate**: If you’re a coder, linguist, or legal expert, your skills would be invaluable.  
- **Spread the Word**: Share this project with anyone who might be interested.

### 💬 **Final Thoughts**  

This project is about making law accessible, transparent, and free for everyone. It’s not about selling anything or making a profit—it’s about creating something that benefits the community.  

So, if you’re as excited about this as I am, let’s make it happen together! 🌟
