### 🌍 **Open-Source Legal Translation Project: LEGAL PROMPS FREE;  Accessible, Accurate Translation!** 🌍  
Hey there, legal enthusiasts, language nerds, and open-source lovers! 👋  

I’m excited to share an open-source project I’ve been tinkering with for a while now. It’s all about making legal texts more accessible by translating them accurately and transparently by adhering to patterns in legal documents. I found better results for translating the text 1:1 *first* and then using it as a reference for any "thightening" tasks; such as Glossarys; Summaries; etc. Anything that attempts to make the text easier to read (visuals; easy summary etc.) is way more accurate for the court docs I translated.

This project started as a personal need (and a bit of a panic 😅) during my Master’s thesis. I accidentally picked a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling that was **80 pages long… in French.** Oops! 🙈 (I confused it with the freindly EUGH that usually publishes in 20+ languages. Lesson learned: always check the language first!)  

This is a bit of a "panic" upload, I dont have a back-up for any of my Chats nor my Chat Bots. I noticed my Bots answers kept getting worse, with no way to restore original depht, I so annoyed at *Openai Bottle Neck* I havent used them for way to long. I was under the impression that are "stable" - but Quality is terrible suddenly,..
Deepseek is way more fun to use; I havent tried transfering or unsing any legal Prompts on any other legal model so I am open to that. I am against law dictating from above, what need to be done technically. Ends as a desaster every time (DSGVO/DSG nur als kleines Beispiel.)
Offen für alles und jede Disskussion. 

## 🛠️ The Solution  
This open-source, non-profit project is here to:  
1. **Break down language barriers**: Provide accurate, transparent translations of legal texts.  
2. **Smash formal barriers**: Create accessible, user-friendly formats that work for everyone—neurodivergent individuals, visually impaired people, and anyone who’s ever struggled with tiny, unreadable fonts.  
3. **Challenge the status quo**: Prove that the best tech is free, open, and built for people, not profit.
