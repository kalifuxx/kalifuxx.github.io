legal background but I started this as a personal project - NO CODE; MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTs- PDFs, WORD.docs etc. AND ACCURACY CAN BE IMPROVED EASILY WITH API CALLS AND DATASETS 
8 000 Charts limit for Prompts felt limiting, regarding more complex usage. The followig 

### 🌍 **LEGAL Open-Source FREE; Accurate Translations!** 🌍  
Hey there, legal enthusiasts, language nerds, and open-source lovers! 👋  

I’m excited to share an open-source project I’ve been tinkering with for a while now. It’s all about making legal texts more accessible by translating them accurately and transparently by adhering to patterns in legal documents. I found better results for translating the text 1:1 *first* and then using it as a reference for any "thightening" tasks; such as Glossarys; Summaries; etc. Anything that attempts to make the text easier to read (visuals; easy summary etc.) is way more accurate for the court docs I translated.

This is a"panic" upload, I dont have a back-up for any of my Chats nor my Chat Bots. I noticed my Bots answers kept getting worse, with no way to restore original depht, I so annoyed at *Openai Bottle Neck* I havent used them for way to long. I was under the impression that are "stable" - but Quality is terrible suddenly,..
🌍Deepseek is way more fun to use; I havent tried transfering or unsing any legal Prompts on any other legal model so I am open to that. I am against law dictating from above, what need to be done technically. Ends as a desaster every time (DSGVO/DSG nur als kleines Beispiel.)
Offen für alles und jede Disskussion. 

## 🌍This open-source tool is here to try legal-multiple-peer-view / alternate approaches 🌍
1. Challenge Legal Assumtions about Tech and KI making everything more complicatedn *only*: more tech = more costs? This makes no sense at all, when was this ever the case? Stop makeing Shit laws now!
4. **Comic Sans, Text-To-Speech, do what IT EXPERTS USE AS STANDARD helps the most, not looks "formal"? **: Create accessible, user-friendly formats that work for everyone — neurodivergent individuals, visually impaired people, and anyone (creator of this prompt mess included! ) who’s ever struggled with tiny, unreadable fonts or other bad practices due to incompetence   
**Challenge stiff legal no-peer-review-standard** Show that the best code is free, open, and profits from interdisciplinary discourse - even in LAW!!
